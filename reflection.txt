First, I used source bodies as the popular speeches of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. For the new bodies of text I chose my diagnostic essay from WR120 class and my response for CS111’s problem 0 of pset1. The results depicted that my WR120 paper is more likely to come from Gandhi’s speech. Similarly, my problem 0 response is more likely to come from the extract from Martin Luther King’s speech. I was able to obtain these results because of my classify function that helped me identify the commonalities between texts. This model evaluated texts based on the following criteria: words, word lengths, stems, sentence lengths and number of punctuations which were weighted 15, 10, 7, 5 and 3 respectively. 


I think the text classification program works fairly well as it appropriately generates scores for comparisons as per the above stated criteria. It also works correctly for fairly large pieces of text. However for the program to be improved, more feature dictionaries could possibly be added to help analyze the given text with more depth and accuracy. More features such as the preference of short vs long words or usage of adjective words could be added to make the program work better.
